/**
 * Control what types you allow to be partially parsed.
 * The default is to allow all types to be partially parsed, which in most casees is the best option.
 * @example
 * If you don't want to allow partial objects, you can use the following code:
 * ```ts
 * import { Allow, parse } from "partial-json";
 * parse(`[{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 3,`, Allow.ARR); // [ { a: 1, b: 2 } ]
 * ```
 * Or you can use `~` to disallow a type:
 * ```ts
 * parse(`[{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 3,`, ~Allow.OBJ); // [ { a: 1, b: 2 } ]
 * ```
 * @example
 * If you don't want to allow partial strings, you can use the following code:
 * ```ts
 * import { Allow, parse } from "partial-json";
 * parse(`["complete string", "incompl`, ~Allow.STR); // [ 'complete string' ]
